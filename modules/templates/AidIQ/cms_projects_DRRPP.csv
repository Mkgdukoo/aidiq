   <a href='http://www.drrprojects.net' target='blank'>The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Project Portal</a>
   collects information on all multi-country and national level DRR projects
   and initiatives in the Asia Pacific region implemented since 2005.
   By facilitating information sharing across the region, the Portal aims to
   advance the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) goals in building the resilience
   of nations and communities to disasters.
  </p>
  <p>
   This includes making disaster risk reduction a high priority on local and national
   levels. There are many priorities for action, such as knowing the risks, enhancing
   early warning systems to reduce vulnerabilities, and building a culture of safety
   and resilience for all people by strengthening networks and working with the media.
  </p>
  <p>The DRR Project Portal:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps effective planning, programming, cooperation, and collaboration of DRR projects and programs in the region by facilitating project analysis to identify gaps and overlaps.</li>
    <li>Is essential for governments, organizations and donors involved in implementing and supporting DRR projects and program in the region.</li>
    <li>Is a useful resource for academics, students and the media for obtaining an overview of DRR projects being implemented in the region.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This Sahana Eden-powered portal was deployed at the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center.</p>
