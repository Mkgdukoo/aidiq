   AidIQ were commissioned by the <a href='http://helios-foundation.org' target='_blank'>HELIOS foundation</a>
   to create a portal to allow NGOs working in the field to be able to share
   information on their In Stock & On Order relief items. This allows them to
   use up surplus items, avoid goods expiring and avoid duplicate procurement.
   Future iterations could include sharing of information on Planned Procurements
   to allow bulk discounts & shared freighting/importation costs. Data can be
   automatically uploaded from HELIOS instances or via manual data entry or
   uploading of spreadsheets.
   This work was done for the <a href='http://thecbha.org' target='_blank'>Consortium of British Humanitarian Agencies</a> & funded by DfID.
