   AidIQ developed the Resource Mapping System (RMS) in Sahana Eden for the
   International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to
   allow their National Societies to share information on their Inventory,
   Assets, Staff and Volunteers.
  <p>
  <p>
   Neighboring National Societies and the IFRC can quickly see what is available
   in the event of a major disaster. This information is blended with data from
   other Geographic Information Systems (GIS), such as Population Density, Rainfall
   and Topography to allow for a more informed planning of the response.

  <p>
   The solution allows agencies to share a common server, yet retain full control
   over their data and who can have access to it (i.e. a multi-tenancy system). The
   open source nature of the software was important because it meant there was no
   vendor lock-in and the software was easy to maintain. For this deployment the
   AidIQ Team deployed using Amazon Web Services in the regional data center to
   guarantee low latency.
  </p>
  <p>
   The solution evolved into a Resource Management System and has been extended many times with new modules, as it was seen as such a cost-effective platform.
