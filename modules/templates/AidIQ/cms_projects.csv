  <h2>Resource Management System</h2>
  <h5>International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)</h5>
  <p>
   AidIQ developed the Resource Management System (RMS) in Sahana Eden for the
   International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to
   allow their National Societies to share information on their Inventory,
   Assets, Staff and Volunteers.
  <p>
  <p>
   Neighboring National Societies and the IFRC can quickly see what is available
   in the event of a major disaster. This information is blended with data from
   other Geographic Information Systems (GIS), such as Population Density, Rainfall
   and Topography to allow for a more informed planning of the response.

  <p>
   The solution allowed agencies to share a common server, yet retain full control
   over their data and who can have access to it (i.e. a multi-tenancy system). The
   open source nature of the software was important because it meant there was no
   vendor lock-in and the software was easy to maintain. For this deployment the
   Sahana Team deployed using Amazon Web Services in the regional data center to
   guarantee low latency.

  <h2>Inter-Agency Information Sharing - HELIOS</h2>
  <p>
   AidIQ were commissioned by the <a href='http://helios-foundation.org' target='_blank'>HELIOS foundation</a>
   to create a portal to allow NGOs working in the field to be able to share
   information on their In Stock & On Order relief items. This allows them to
   use up surplus items, avoid goods expiring and avoid duplicate procurement.
   Future iterations could include sharing of information on Planned Procurements
   to allow bulk discounts & shared freighting/importation costs. Data can be
   automatically uploaded from HELIOS instances or via manual data entry or
   uploading of spreadsheets.
   This work was done for the <a href='http://thecbha.org' target='_blank'>Consortium of British Humanitarian Agencies</a> & funded by DfID.

  <h2>DRR Project Portal</h2>
  <h5>Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC)</h5>
  <p>
   <a href='http://www.drrprojects.net' target='blank'>The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Project Portal</a>
   collects information on all multi-country and national level DRR projects
   and initiatives in the Asia Pacific region implemented since 2005.
   By facilitating information sharing across the region, the Portal aims to
   advance the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) goals in building the resilience
   of nations and communities to disasters.
  </p>
  <p>
   This includes making disaster risk reduction a high priority on local and national
   levels. There are many priorities for action, such as knowing the risks, enhancing
   early warning systems to reduce vulnerabilities, and building a culture of safety
   and resilience for all people by strengthening networks and working with the media.
  </p>
  <p>The DRR Project Portal:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps effective planning, programming, cooperation, and collaboration of DRR projects and programs in the region by facilitating project analysis to identify gaps and overlaps.</li>
    <li>Is essential for governments, organizations and donors involved in implementing and supporting DRR projects and program in the region.</li>
    <li>Is a useful resource for academics, students and the media for obtaining an overview of DRR projects being implemented in the region.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This Sahana Eden-powered portal was deployed at the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center.</p>

  <h2>Information Management Workshop - BPKEL</h2>
  <p>
   AidIQ facilitated a series of workshops for BPKEL (Badan Pengelola Kawasan
   Ekosistem Leuser), the Aceh Conservation Agency in order to improve their
   information management processes to better comply with requirements of the
   REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programme.
   After the first workshop, the current processes were documented and gaps were
   identified. A draft solutions document was then written and a second workshop
   was held to review and refine this document. BPKEL have agreed to share the
   final Information Management Standard Operating Procedures which were
   developed as a result of these workshops.
