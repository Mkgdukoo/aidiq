   AidIQ facilitated a series of workshops for BPKEL (Badan Pengelola Kawasan
   Ekosistem Leuser), the Aceh Conservation Agency in order to improve their
   information management processes to better comply with requirements of the
   REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programme.
   After the first workshop, the current processes were documented and gaps were
   identified. A draft solutions document was then written and a second workshop
   was held to review and refine this document. BPKEL have agreed to share the
   final Information Management Standard Operating Procedures which were
   developed as a result of these workshops.
